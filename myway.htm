<p align="center"><font size="4">And now <br>
The end is near<br>
And so I face <br>
The final curtain <br>
<br>
My friend <br>
I'll say it clear <br>
I'll state my case <br>
Of which I'm certain <br>
<br>
I've lived <br>
A life that's full <br>
I've travelled each<br>
And every highway <br>
<br>
And more <br>
Much more than this <br>
I did it my way <br>
<br>
Regrets <br>
I've had a few <br>
But then again <br>
Too few to mention <br>
<br>
I did <br>
What I had to do <br>
And saw it through <br>
Without exemption <br>
<br>
I planned <br>
Each chartered course <br>
Each careful step <br>
Along the byway <br>
<br>
And more <br>
Much more than this<br>
I dit it my way </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">Yes, there were times <br>
I'm sure you knew <br>
When I bit off <br>
More than I could chew<br>
But through it all <br>
When there was doubt <br>
I ate it up <br>
And spit it out <br>
I faced it all <br>
And I stood tall <br>
And did it my way</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">I've loved <br>
I've laughed and cried <br>
I've had my fill <br>
My share of losing <br>
<br>
And now <br>
As tears subside <br>
I find it all <br>
So amusing <br>
<br>
To think <br>
I did all that <br>
And may I say <br>
Not in a shy way <br>
<br>
Oh no <br>
Oh no, not me <br>
I did it my way </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">For what is a man <br>
What has he got <br>
If not himself <br>
Then he has not <br>
To say the things <br>
He'd truly feels <br>
And not the words <br>
Of one who kneels <br>
The record shows <br>
I took the blows <br>
And did it my way <br>
<br>
Yes it was my way </font></p>
